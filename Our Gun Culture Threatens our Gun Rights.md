Our Gun Culture Threatens our Gun Rights
========================================

The joint wisdom of the pro-gun people and the anti-gun people in America is that _our gun culture protects gun rights_. I think that's not quite right. For one, the case that we have a right to bear arms while people in other first world nations don't is overstated. I contend that we don't really have that right in America, at least _not when said right is likely to do any good_. American gun culture is also joined at the hip with various fucked up attitudes that ensure this remains the case. The only upside if you believe in gun rights is that _if you have access to guns_, you have access to a wide array of types of guns and have more freedom to have them on your person than you would in many other developed nations. But you're much less likely to have that right if you're a disadvantaged group that's more likely to experience violence.

Another bipartisan belief is "the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun". This is a catch phrase of NRA types, but it's pretty broadly bought into implicitly. You might see "good guys" as cops and private citizens who pass a background check or you might narrow that list to just certain cops. Unless you are of the minority opinion that _no one_ should have guns, you can't truly say you disagree with the statement. The problem is who we consider "bad guys". That often means criminals. Who commits crime? A better way to phrase the question is "whose livelihoods are criminalized?" The answer of course is disadvantaged groups, people driven to taboo and illegal activities by discrimination, which means the same people most likely to experience violence.

It isn't even simply a matter of having a right on paper to truly have a right. It is often the case that despite all the obstacles, someone does have the _legal_ right to have a gun and have it on their person. That may be necessary but it's not sufficient. In a country where a cop can [gun down an black child with a toy gun and get away with it](http://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7275297/tamir-rice-police-shooting) it's difficult to conclude that _any_ African American truly has the right to carry. There's not a strong separation between law and culture. The two influence each other, and solving our violence problem won't happen without addressing both.

Behind our strong cultural belief in gun rights is the idea that the world is dangerous, it's full of dangerous people, and you need to use force to protect yourself sometimes. This bodes well for the right of a rich white property owner to have a gun in their house in preparation for exotic threats like hot break-ins. But not if you're in the out-group, if you're thought of as dangerous, if you ever got in trouble or got diagnosed. It's not to the benefit of a trans women of color who's been pushed by discrimination into prostitution and faces a much more realistic threat of violence. Note how it's exactly the most die-hard gun nuts who are quick to blame those diagnosed with mental illness when tragedy strikes. They see neurodivergent people and drug dealers as a threat to their own gun collection and care nothing about them as people.

Gun people are quick to point out the alleged hypocricy of pro-gun control politicians protecting themselves with armed body guards. And their detractors are quick to point out the silliness of the belief that everyone is under equal threat of violence. It's true that public figures are at a greater risk of assassination attempts than the general public is of murder attempts. But that's not the only distinction. People living in more violent areas (which usually means lower-income individuals) face more violence. Blacks face more violence than whites. LGBT+ individuals, especially trans women, face extraordinarily high rates of violence. And unlike rich politicians, most of these people can't afford body guards.

If you own weapons, there's some risk that you might accidentally hurt yourself or someone you didn't mean to with them. There's also some likelihood that you could protect yourself or others with them. For most people, the likelihood of both of those things are rather small but the latter is smaller. I imagine a cross section of humanity graphed against the likelihood of positive use divided by the likelihood of accidents. There must be some people who exist above the line (if I'm wrong, then there's no reason for anyone to have guns). I contend it is those people who are the most likely to not have a right to own weapons who fall above the 100% line. Therefore, we do not have a right to own weapons. We only have a right to engage in an expensive hobby.

Most people identify with their own government to some degree. Even if they largely disagree with its actions, they see government guns as vital to their own safety as they see their own. The people who oppose reductions in military or police presence the most are the ones who oppose restrictions on gun rights the most, generally speaking. I contend it's because the reasoning is similar in both cases. It's not about viewing gun rights as a human right, it's about "I'm going to be scary and dangerous to protect myself from danger". This association means that guns can never be a way to protect against government tyranny. The idea of standing up to our military with our guns is so laughable, especially given the people who tend to hold the position, that it [was the subject of one of Clickhole's finer gags](http://www.clickhole.com/blogpost/its-our-duty-support-troops-and-second-amendment-c-1929). If you believe that protection from government tyranny is a valid reason to support gun rights, then you _must_ be for massive reduction of government guns.

Whether you see gun rights as something worthy of protection or not, the American gun movement and our gun culture aren't your friends. If there are good arguments to be put forth, it's by taking a firm grasp of reality and not escaping the problems inheret in our culture. We must not only dismantle the various laws that increase violence like the war on drugs (more properly thought of as the war on drug users) and the war on sex workers, but also strike at the root causes of murder and assault like toxic masculinity, white supremacy, heterosexism and transantagonism.
