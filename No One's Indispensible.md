No One's Indispensible
======================

Last week at the [International Students For Liberty Conference (ISFLC)](http://isflc.org/), Ron Paul once again misgendered and deadnamed whistleblower and hero to libertarians everywhere, Chelsea Manning in a speech. Though his words otherwise sounded supportive, they indicate someone who *at best* hasn't paid attention to any news pertaining to her. More likely, he and the people he surrounds himself with disrespect not only Manning, but trans identities everywhere. As soon as he said this, some people in the audience, including some people from [C4SS](http://c4ss.org) shouted back to correct him. In return, rabid Ron Paul supporters have responded with insults and threats. This needs to stop.

But this isn't about Ron Paul or about any particular celebrity. It's about our tendency as a movement to treat some people as irreplaceable because of what they have done at some point in the past. It's not only counter-productive, but goes against libertarian principles. Once you get over the intellectual-property based thinking our society adheres to where an idea *belongs* to someone, yourealize that continuing where someone left of isn't uniquely that person's perogative.

Ron Paul got famous making tirades against endless wars and against The Fed on widely televised Republican primary debates. Libertarianism, even if it were his odd brand thereof, made its way into our living rooms and his name got spoken at dinner table conversations. But other people hold similar views as him on these issues without his numerous problems, including the infamous [racist newsletters](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/ron-paul-and-the-racist-newsletters-fact-checker-biography/2011/12/21/gIQAKNiwBP_blog.html).

The common retort to any criticism of him is that he's *already* famous among the general public and whoever you offer as an alternative isn't. This may technically be true, but it's also a self-fulfilling prophecy. We must forget the capitalist mythology of the superman who rises from rags to riches entirely on his own strength. He got where he got by the help of people around him. That includes many hard-core conservatives, which is why he finds himself unable to say things that would upset that camp (such as, I don't know, respecting trans identities). But he also got a lot of help from our movement and continues to be given a platform. Again, this needs to stop.
