No One's Indispensible
======================

Last week at the [International Students For Liberty Conference (ISFLC)](http://isflc.org/), Ron Paul once again misgendered and deadnamed whistleblower and hero to libertarians everywhere, Chelsea Manning in a speech. Though his words otherwise sounded supportive, they indicate someone who *at best* hasn't paid attention to any news pertaining to her. More likely, he and the people he surrounds himself with disrespect not only Manning, but trans identities everywhere. As soon as he said this, some people in the audience, including some people from [C4SS](http://c4ss.org) shouted back to correct him. In return, rabid Ron Paul supporters have responded with insults and threats. This needs to stop.
